                        Wordle game for the Unix console
                        --------------------------------

This is a clone of the popular Wordle game playable on a regular Unix terminal

Two dictionaries are used:

  - A frequency list - i.e. a list of words sorted by reverse usage frequency
  - A larger, unsorted list of extra words

The word to guess is picked from the frequency list more or less near the top
according to the difficulty level. The guesswords the user is allowed to enter
are checked against both lists, so the user can enter valid wild guesses to
draw out letter matches.

Different lists and game parameters are used in different language packs:

  * en_GB (British English):

    The frequency list is based on the frequency list produced in the
    Centre for Translation Studies, University of Leed and distributed
    under the Creative Commons (CC BY) Attribution license.
    For more information see http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/list.html

    The list of extra words is based on the British English Debian
    English word list package (wbritish), built from the SCOWL
    (Spell-Checker Oriented Word Lists) package, whose upstream editor is
    Kevin Atkinson <kev‐ina@users.sourceforge.net>.

  * fi_FI (Finnish):

    The frequency list is based on the 9996 most common lemmas in the language
    of Finnish newspapers (available under the terms of the Creative Commons
    Non Commercial license 1.0).

    The list of extra words is based on the contemporary Finnish words list
    from the Finnish Language Research center, version 1, published 12/15/06
    under the terms of the GNU LGPL license.

Use the -l or -L switches to change language. Renaming the program "sanuli"
or "sanuli.py" will also automatically start the game in Finnish.

Use -n to change the number of letters, -a to change the number of attempts and
-d to change the level of difficulty.
