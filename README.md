# wordle - v1.0.0
## Wordle game for the Unix console

This is a clone of the popular Wordle game playable on a regular Unix terminal

The dictionary files should be flat files with one word per line. They are commonly installed in ```/usr/share/*spell/``` or ```/usr/share/dict/```. If you don't see files there, try installing ```hunspell-en-us``` or ```wamerican```.
The program tries to load as many of the files listed in the parameters.

The larger the final combined dictionary, the more varied the words of course.



[Debian](https://github.com/Giraut/ppa) and [RPM](https://github.com/Giraut/rpm) Linux packages are also available.
